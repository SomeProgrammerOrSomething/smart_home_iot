You don't even need to take your phone out of your pocket or purse; just touch your lock, it will recognize your phone and unlock the door. No more fumbling for your keys or memorizing a code... just touch the lock to open. Compatible with Apple iPhone 4s and 5 only.;No Smartphone? No Problem The Kevo Fob, that is included with the lock, offers the same touch to open technology and convenience. Leave your fob in your pocket or purse and when you touch the lock, it will recognize your fob and unlock the door. Additional Kevo Fobs will be available for purchase. Send an eKey The key has evolved! Now you can send an electronic key (eKey) to family, friends, or visitors who have a compatible smartphone, so they can use their phone as a key too.   Kevo Mobile App It all starts with the Kevo mobile app that you can download for free from the Apple store. This app allows you to set up your Kevo lock, send, disable or delete eKeys, as well as manage Kevo fobs Is Kevo compatible with my smartphone? Kevo is only compatible with smartphones that support Bluetooth Smart Ready/Bluetooth 4.0 hardware and have an available Kevo app. The Kevo app is currently available for iPhone 4s & 5, as well as the fifth generation iPod touch, third generation or higher iPad and iPad mini. We have plans to support all possible mobile devices. Currently Android 4.3 and Blackberry 10.1 do not fully support all Bluetooth LE features required by Kevo, but we hope they will soon. When they do, we will be ready! You can still enjoy touch-to-open entry with a key fob and migrate to your Android device when available.   Can someone hack into my Kevo lock? The Kevo lock does not only rely on the built-in encryption available in Bluetooth. Kevo also provides multiple levels of military grade PKI encryption.   What is the battery life? The Kevo lock operates on 4 AA batteries and with normal use, the batteries should last for a year before needing replacing. The lock provides multiple low battery indicators and provides plenty of warning to change batteries. In the event that the batteries are not replaced in time, you will need to use the standard key to unlock the door.   When I'm inside the house, can someone touch the Kevo lock to unlock it from the outside? No, the Kevo lock has a unique and patent pending feature to detect if the authorized user is inside or outside of the house, so there will be no accidental unlocking from an unauthorized user outside.   How will the Kevo App affect my smartphone battery life? The Kevo App needs Location Services and Bluetooth to be on, which do use some battery power (you would already be using this if you use other mapping apps or Bluetooth devices). The Kevo App is designed to take advantage of the new ultra-power-efficient Bluetooth Smart Ready Technology, so you shouldn't notice a decrease in your phone's battery life.   What happens if I lose my phone? Simply log into the Kevo app on another smartphone or into the Kevo web portal and disable or delete any eKeys associated with the lock. You will need to use your Kevo Fob or the standard key to unlock the lock until you retrieve or replace your phone.    	%%%%%		Smart Lock

Genie Open the door for anyone such as delivery or repair persons, relatives, or friends when they call or text you upon their arrival, so you don't have to provide a temporary access password.  Genie Have a history for each opener of when the door was used including dates & times.  Genie Know when someone is manually operating your door so you can take necessary steps to find out who and why.  Genie Time-based Features Genie Virtual Keys  Create a virtual key as it allows homeowners to provide temporary or permanent access to relatives, friends, or service workers. Simply have the person download the free app, add their name to your list of users and what time length of access you want to give, and you're all set. Their virtual key will expire in an hour, a day, a month, or whatever time frame you set.  Genie Automatically Close at a Certain Time  Set your door to automatically close at any time. For example, maybe everyone in the house has been using the garage at different times and it's hard to tell if the last person using it closed the door for the night. So to be safe, you set it to automatically close at 10 p.m. in case the last person using it for the day forgets to close it.  Genie Automatically Close After a Set Time Frame  Set your garage door to close after a set time frame. Let's say everyone in the house knows to close the door after they're done in the garage so it's not open too long for bugs or rodents to get in. But just in case they forget, you can set the door to always automatically close after one or two hours of being continually open, or whatever timeframe you set.  	%%%%%	WiFi	Smart Garage
